# Deep-Semantic-Similarity-Model-PyTorch
Implementation of C-DSSM(Microsoft Research Paper) described [here](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/226585/cikm2014_cdssm_final.pdf). A random data generator is included in the code, you can play with it or use your own data.

Code is highly influenced from [airalcorn2/Deep-Semantic-Similarity-Model](https://github.com/airalcorn2/Deep-Semantic-Similarity-Model).
